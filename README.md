# qrwebsite
a smol cool weird ahh goofy website for say cheese ysws :D

## what is it about
click on 'add cheese' to add cheese to the pizza, really simple. It was kinda fun doing this except that I have to fit it in like 3kb, which I guess I deleted a lot of stuff (took 90% of the time ðŸ˜­)

## wat i do
sooo I just did the art and all pretty cool with aseprite (thank you pirates of aseprite hehe) anddd i got the font somewhere from online, edited it and all to online contain undercase characters for 'add cheese' and 'make a pizza'. But the font was deleted at the end tho. There was a cursor too (from online) that also got deleted at the final version.

`index.html` is the original version<br>
`compressed/compressed.html` is the final one that is used to make the qr
